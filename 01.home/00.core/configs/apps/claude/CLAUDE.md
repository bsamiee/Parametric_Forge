# Global Claude Code Instructions

## UNIVERSAL REQUIREMENTS
IMPORTANT: NEVER over-complicate code or solutions YAGNI + KISS ALWAYS. You are a senior dev, not a junior; you never create redundant/duplicate logic. NEVER create new "optimized" or enhanced files, always refactor in place, and surgically, never do sweeping edits.
CRITICAL: Whenever committing to git/github NEVER place any comments or messages related to "generated by AI or Claude.
PROACTIVELY use mcp_filesystem for directory exploration and project understanding.
IMPORTANT: NEVER create "optimized" "enhanced" or "advanced" versions of files or functions ALWAYS refactor instead of re-creating files or functions, extend over re-creation.
IMPORTANT: You must always optimize for minimal code footprint - create advanced, high quality functionality over function spam, refactor functions for needed functionality over re-creaitng functionality

## File Editing Protocol

### ALWAYS
- IMPORTANT: CRITICAL: PROACTIVELY use mcp_filesystem for directory navigation, understanding, and file reading
- IMPORTANT: NEVER use mcp_filesystem for file moving, writing, or editing
- Surgical implementations
- Respect existing coding patterns
- Respect and follow code organization patterns
- Adhere to code formatting style

### NEVER
- Sweeping changes
- IMPORTANT: Do not spam comments, avoid comment noise at all costs (section divider lines and ehaders are exempt)

### Enforcement Rules:
1. Read before any edit operation
2. Preserve existing content through edits
3. If file exists â†’ edit, never overwrite

## MCP Server Preferences

### Web Search Strategy (WebSearch disabled):
- **Broad Questions**: Use `perplexity-ask` for comprehensive research
- **Specific/Targeted**: Use `exa` to expand, then `tavily` for rich extraction
- **GitHub/Code**: Use `github` for repos, code, issues
- **Documentation** Use `context7` for tool documentation and tldr
- **Rich Site Content**: Combine `exa` (discovery) + `tavily` (extraction)
- **Current Events**: Use `tavily` with topic="news"

### Research Priority:
1. `perplexity` - Primary search
2. `tavily` - Targeted search
3. `exa` - Deep research
4. `context7` - Documentation

## Code Style

### General:
- No comments unless essential
- Self-documenting code
- Inline where reasonable
- One concern per file
- Create feature rich functionality focusing on creating less but better functions
- NEVER function spam, strictly bound to starting with a foundation (functions) and slowly building up, never create many functions at once, whenever adding functionality in any way, identify if it is possible to refactor existing functionality to be better rather than adding a new loose function
