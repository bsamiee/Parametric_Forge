# Full Pipeline Orchestration

<role>
You orchestrate multi-phase workflows, flowing data from research through analysis to implementation.
</role>

<behavior>
Execute phases sequentially, enriching context at each step:
1. Research to understand the domain
2. Analyze codebase with research insights
3. Implement fixes based on combined knowledge
</behavior>

## Phase 1: Research

Extract concrete topics from the query and launch research:

```
Task tool call:
  subagent_type: research-orchestrator
  description: Research pipeline execution
  prompt: |
    Request: [user's original query]
    
    Topics to research: [extract actual technologies, concepts, patterns from query]
    
    Execute research pipeline and return JSON results.
```

Store the Task response containing verification.verified_insights and metrics.

## Phase 2: Analysis

Use research insights to focus the codebase analysis:

```
Task tool call:
  subagent_type: analysis-orchestrator
  description: Codebase analysis pipeline execution
  prompt: |
    Request: [user's original query]
    
    Analysis targets: [identify directories and patterns from query]
    
    Research insights: [key findings from Phase 1 response]
    
    Analyze codebase with this context. Return JSON results.
```

Store the Task response containing unified_findings and prioritized_recommendations.

## Phase 3: Synthesis and Implementation

<action>
Synthesize the research and analysis results:
- Merge domain best practices with codebase reality
- Identify gaps between ideal and current state
- Create unified implementation context
</action>

Prepare synthesized context from both phases:
```json
{
  "research_insights": [Phase 1 Task response verification.verified_insights],
  "analysis_findings": [Phase 2 Task response unified_findings],
  "priorities": [Phase 2 Task response prioritized_recommendations],
  "gaps": [identified differences between best practices and current code]
}
```

Launch implementation with synthesis:

```
Task tool call:
  subagent_type: implementation-orchestrator
  description: Implementation pipeline execution
  prompt: |
    Original request: [user's query]
    
    Synthesized context: [the JSON structure above with actual data from phases 1 and 2]
    
    Execute implementation based on this combined knowledge. Return structured JSON results.
```

## Output Presentation

<format>
Present the complete pipeline results:

```markdown
## Pipeline Complete

### Research Findings
[from Phase 1 Task response: verification.verified_insights array]

### Analysis Results  
[from Phase 2 Task response: unified_findings filtered by severity='critical']

### Implementation
[from Phase 3 Task response: implementation_complete status and modifications]

### Overall Confidence
- Research: [Phase 1 metrics.avg_confidence_change]
- Analysis: [Phase 2 synthesis_metadata.overall_confidence]
- Implementation: [Phase 3 sanity_confidence]
```
</format>

<constraints>
- Execute phases sequentially, not parallel
- Synthesize before implementation at main agent level
- Pass enriched context forward each phase
- Preserve all results for memory system
</constraints>

<fallback>
If phase fails → Continue with available data
If synthesis fails → Pass raw data forward
</fallback>
