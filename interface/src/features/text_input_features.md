## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. Word-wise cursor movement and deletion
2. Proper Unicode/wide character support
3. Smart horizontal scrolling
4. Multi-line support (if needed for forms)
5. Undo/redo system

### Medium Priority (Enhanced UX)
1. Yank/paste operations
2. Search functionality
3. Selection system
4. Tab handling
5. Delete to end of line operations

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Syntax highlighting
2. Line numbers
3. Auto-completion
4. Input masks
5. Regular expression search

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements
- Implement word-wise operations
- Add proper Unicode support
- Implement smart scrolling
- Add forward delete

### Phase 2: Multi-line Support
- Add multi-line mode configuration
- Implement vertical navigation
- Add line operations
- Implement viewport management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add undo/redo system
- Implement yank/paste
- Add search functionality
- Implement selection system

### Phase 4: Polish
- Add visual enhancements
- Implement auto-completion
- Add input masks
- Optimize performance

## Integration Considerations

### With font-patcher.nix
- Use Nerd Fonts for visual indicators (search, validation, etc.)
- Add icons for different input modes
- Visual feedback with icon animations

### With existing architecture
- Leverage existing validation framework
- Integrate with Action system for operations
- Use existing theme system for new visual features
- Extend Component trait as needed

## Notes

Our current implementation uses `tui_input::Input` internally but doesn't expose most of its features. We could:
1. Better leverage the existing tui_input capabilities
2. Extend the wrapper to expose more tui_input features
3. Consider replacing with ratatui-textarea for multi-line needs
4. Build a hybrid approach using both libraries

The gap analysis shows significant room for improvement, particularly in:
- Text manipulation operations
- Multi-line support
- History/undo functionality
- Visual feedback and enhancements
