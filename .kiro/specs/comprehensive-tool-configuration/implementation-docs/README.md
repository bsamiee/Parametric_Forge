# Implementation Documentation

This directory contains organized documentation for implementing the comprehensive tool configuration system.

## Directory Structure

### `platform-specific/`
Documentation for platform-specific configuration requirements and patterns.

- **`darwin-specific.md`** - macOS-specific configuration requirements, environment variables, and integration patterns

### `integration-guides/`
Step-by-step guides for integrating configurations into the existing system.

*Future documentation will be organized here for step 8 and beyond.*

## Purpose

This separate documentation structure keeps implementation details organized and easily accessible, separate from the research and analysis documents in the main `docs/` folder.

## Usage

- **Step 7 Documentation**: Platform-specific configuration requirements → `platform-specific/`
- **Step 8 Documentation**: Integration guides and patterns → `integration-guides/`
- **Future Steps**: Additional implementation documentation as needed

This organization makes it easier to find specific implementation guidance without navigating through research documents and configuration examples.
