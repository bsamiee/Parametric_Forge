# Reference Implementation: Static Configuration Files

This directory contains the complete reference implementation for static configuration files, organized following the validated directory structure from the existing system.

## Directory Organization

├── git/           # Git-related configs (gitignore, gitattributes)
├── languages/     # Language-specific tools (rust-analyzer, basedpyright)
├── development/   # Development workflow tools (just, jq, etc.)
├── system/        # System monitoring and utilities

```

## Implementation Status

All configuration files in this reference implementation are **fully commented out** and serve as documentation and templates. They demonstrate:

- Proper file headers and organization
- Comprehensive commenting standards
- XDG compliance patterns
- Platform-specific considerations
- Integration with environment variables
- Tool-specific configuration best practices

## Usage

These files are templates and examples - not active configurations. Use them to:

1. Understand proper configuration structure
2. See comprehensive commenting examples
3. Learn XDG compliance patterns
4. Study platform-specific handling
5. Guide implementation of actual configurations
