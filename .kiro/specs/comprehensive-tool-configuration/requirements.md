# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive configuration management for all tools in the Parametric Forge system. Currently, the system has 100+ tools across multiple package categories but lacks systematic configuration coverage. The goal is to create a complete, organized configuration system that properly handles all tools through appropriate `programs/` (declarative Nix-managed configs) and `configs/` (large static config files) structures, along with proper XDG compliance, environment variables, and file management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Tool Inventory and Classification

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a complete inventory of all tools with their configuration requirements, so that I can ensure comprehensive coverage and avoid configuration gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing package files THEN the system SHALL identify all 100+ unique tools across all package categories
2. WHEN creating mental categorization map THEN the system SHALL group tools by logical configuration patterns:
   - Development workflow tools (editors, formatters, linters)
   - System utilities (file managers, process monitors, network tools)
   - Language ecosystems (runtime + toolchain + package managers)
   - Container and DevOps tools (docker, kubernetes, CI/CD)
   - Shell enhancements (prompt, history, completion)
3. WHEN classifying tools THEN the system SHALL categorize each tool as requiring:
   - `programs/` configuration (declarative Nix-managed)
   - `configs/` configuration (static config files)
   - Both `programs/` and `configs/`
   - No configuration needed
4. WHEN documenting tools THEN the system SHALL include tool purpose, configuration method, and XDG compliance status
5. WHEN identifying missing configurations THEN the system SHALL highlight tools that have packages but no corresponding configuration

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Tool Documentation Research

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed documentation research for each tool, so that I understand their configuration capabilities, limitations, and integration requirements before implementing configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN researching each tool THEN the system SHALL read current official documentation to understand configuration options
2. WHEN analyzing tool capabilities THEN the system SHALL document all environment variables the tool supports or uses
3. WHEN examining path requirements THEN the system SHALL identify all file paths the tool uses and whether they can be customized
4. WHEN assessing XDG compliance THEN the system SHALL determine if the tool supports XDG directories natively or via environment variables
5. WHEN evaluating configuration methods THEN the system SHALL determine if the tool needs `programs/`, `configs/`, or both
6. WHEN identifying file management needs THEN the system SHALL document any special file deployment requirements beyond basic config files
7. WHEN tools have limitations THEN the system SHALL document what cannot be configured (e.g., prettier requiring project-root configs)
8. WHEN research is complete THEN each tool SHALL have a documented profile including: config method, env vars, paths, XDG support, and limitations

### Requirement 3: Systematic Programs Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want declarative Nix-managed configurations for all applicable tools, so that my development environment is reproducible and version-controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating programs configurations THEN the system SHALL use home-manager program modules where available
2. WHEN a tool supports declarative configuration THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding `programs/*.nix` file
3. WHEN multiple related tools exist THEN the system SHALL group them logically (e.g., `git-tools.nix`, `container-tools.nix`)
4. WHEN programs configurations are created THEN they SHALL follow the established file header and section organization standards
5. WHEN programs are configured THEN they SHALL integrate with existing XDG and environment variable patterns

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Static Configuration Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly organized static configuration files for tools that require them, so that complex configurations are maintainable and properly deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools require large static configs THEN the system SHALL place them in appropriate `configs/` subdirectories
2. WHEN organizing config files THEN the system SHALL use logical groupings:
   - `configs/languages/` for language-specific tools
   - `configs/apps/` for application configurations
   - `configs/formatting/` for code formatting tools
   - `configs/containers/` for container runtime configs
3. WHEN config files are created THEN they SHALL include proper file headers matching the formatting standards
4. WHEN static configs exist THEN they SHALL be properly linked via `file-management.nix`

### Requirement 5: XDG Base Directory Compliance

**User Story:** As a system user, I want all tools to respect XDG Base Directory specifications, so that my home directory remains clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools support XDG directories THEN the system SHALL configure them to use XDG paths
2. WHEN tools don't support XDG natively THEN the system SHALL use environment variables to redirect them
3. WHEN XDG compliance is impossible THEN the system SHALL document the limitation and use the least intrusive fallback
4. WHEN new XDG paths are needed THEN they SHALL be added to `environment.nix` with proper documentation
5. WHEN file management is updated THEN it SHALL properly handle both XDG-compliant and legacy tool requirements

### Requirement 6: Environment Variable Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive environment variable management for all tools, so that they integrate seamlessly with the system configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools require environment variables THEN they SHALL be defined in `environment.nix` with clear documentation
2. WHEN environment variables affect XDG compliance THEN they SHALL be grouped in the XDG section
3. WHEN tools have performance-related env vars THEN they SHALL be included in the performance section
4. WHEN privacy/telemetry opt-outs are available THEN they SHALL be included in the privacy section
5. WHEN new categories of env vars are needed THEN they SHALL follow the established sectioning pattern

### Requirement 7: File Management Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper file management for all configuration files, so that they are deployed to the correct locations with appropriate permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static config files exist THEN they SHALL be properly linked in `file-management.nix`
2. WHEN tools require XDG config files THEN they SHALL use `xdg.configFile`
3. WHEN tools require home directory files THEN they SHALL use `home.file`
4. WHEN tools require data files THEN they SHALL use `xdg.dataFile` with platform awareness
5. WHEN file management is updated THEN it SHALL include clear comments explaining tool requirements and limitations

### Requirement 8: Missing Configuration Identification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all tools that currently lack proper configuration, so that I can prioritize configuration work and ensure complete coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing packages to configurations THEN the system SHALL identify tools without any configuration
2. WHEN analyzing existing configurations THEN the system SHALL identify incomplete or outdated configurations
3. WHEN tools have partial configuration THEN the system SHALL identify missing components (programs vs configs)
4. WHEN configuration gaps are found THEN they SHALL be documented with priority levels
5. WHEN tools are added to packages THEN the system SHALL prompt for corresponding configuration

### Requirement 9: Configuration Template System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized templates for creating new tool configurations, so that all configurations follow consistent patterns and include necessary components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new programs configurations THEN they SHALL follow the established template pattern
2. WHEN creating new config files THEN they SHALL include proper file headers and organization
3. WHEN adding environment variables THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate sections with documentation
4. WHEN updating file management THEN new entries SHALL follow the established commenting and organization patterns
5. WHEN configurations are created THEN they SHALL be immediately integrated and tested

### Requirement 10: Platform-Specific Configuration Handling

**User Story:** As a cross-platform user, I want configurations that properly handle platform differences, so that the system works correctly on both macOS and Linux.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools have platform-specific requirements THEN they SHALL be handled with appropriate conditionals
2. WHEN macOS-specific tools exist THEN they SHALL be properly isolated to Darwin configurations
3. WHEN Linux-specific configurations are needed THEN they SHALL be handled in the NixOS section
4. WHEN file paths differ between platforms THEN they SHALL be handled with platform detection

### Requirement 11: Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation of all tool configurations, so that the system is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configurations are created THEN they SHALL include inline documentation explaining purpose and integration
2. WHEN tools have special requirements THEN they SHALL be documented with TODO comments for future improvements
3. WHEN configuration limitations exist THEN they SHALL be clearly documented
4. WHEN new tools are added THEN the documentation SHALL be updated to reflect the changes
5. WHEN configuration patterns change THEN existing configurations SHALL be updated to maintain consistency
